Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

//P: string
//R: console
//P: 
const corrections = {
  '5': 'S',
  '0': 'O',
  '1': 'I',
};

const correct = string => (
  string.replace(/[501]/g, character => corrections[character])
);
//E:
correct("LOND0N") // LONDON
