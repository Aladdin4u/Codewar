/**
 Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
**/  
//P: string
//R: console
//P: 
function disemvowel(str) {
  return str.replace(/[a|A|e|E|i|I|o|O|u|U]/g, "");
}
//E:
disemvowel("This website is for losers LOL!")// "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
