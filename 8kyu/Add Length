What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

Example(Input --> Output)

"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.

//P: String 
//R: console

function addLength(str) {
 const spaceStr = str.split(' ')
 let res =[];
 for(let i = 0; i < spaceStr.length; i++){
   let currWord = spaceStr[i]
   res.push(`${currWord} ${currWord.length}`)
 }
  return res;
}

console.log(addLength("apple ban")) // ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
