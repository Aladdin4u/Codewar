/**
In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

//P: array
//R: console
//P:
function findDifference(a, b) {
  const Va = a.reduce((a,c) => a * c,1)
  const Vb = b.reduce((a,c) => a * c, 1)
  return Math.abs(Va - Vb)
}
console.log(findDifference([1,2, 2],[5,4,1])) // 16
